## Introduction

This repository is designed to help bioinformaticians familiarize themselves with basic Linux commands and workflows. Mastery of these skills is essential for effectively managing data, automating tasks, and using bioinformatics tools.

## Installation

To get started, you need to have a Linux environment. You can use:

- **Ubuntu**: A popular Linux distribution, available for free at [Ubuntu Downloads](https://ubuntu.com/download).
- **CentOS/RHEL**: Enterprise Linux distributions often used in research environments.
- **WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux, if you are using Windows 10 or later. Follow the [Microsoft guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for installation.

## Basic Linux Commands

Here you'll find a collection of fundamental Linux commands that are crucial for navigating and managing files:

- `ls`: List directory contents
- `cd`: Change directory
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cp`: Copy files and directories
- `mv`: Move/rename files and directories
- `rm`: Remove files and directories

For a detailed explanation of these commands, check out the [Basic Commands Tutorial](docs/basic_commands.md).

## File and Directory Management

Learn how to efficiently manage files and directories in Linux:

- **Creating Directories**: `mkdir <dir_name>`
- **Removing Directories**: `rmdir <dir_name>`
- **Searching for Files**: `find` and `grep`
- **File Permissions**: `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`

See the [File Management Guide](docs/file_management.md) for more information.

## Text Processing

Text processing is crucial in bioinformatics for handling data files:

- **Viewing Files**: `cat`, `less`, `more`
- **Editing Files**: `nano`, `vim`
- **Searching Text**: `grep`
- **Processing Text**: `awk`, `sed`

Check out the [Text Processing Techniques](docs/text_processing.md) section for examples and exercises.

## Bioinformatics Tools

Explore common bioinformatics tools and their usage:

- **FastQC**: Quality control for high-throughput sequencing data
- **BLAST**: Sequence alignment tool
- **BEDTools**: Tools for genome arithmetic

Refer to the [Bioinformatics Tools Overview](docs/bioinformatics_tools.md) for installation instructions and usage examples.
